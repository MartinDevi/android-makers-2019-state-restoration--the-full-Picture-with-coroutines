# MVP - Coroutines 

The goal of this project is to show a simple application which uses the MVP pattern with the android `ViewModel` library in order to retain the instance state for its provider, in combination with a `Bundle`. This way, its dynamic state can survive configuration changes and its static state can survive the Android Low Memory Killer.
